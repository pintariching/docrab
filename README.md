# Docrab
An EDMS (Electronic document managment system) written in rust. I've split the project into a frontend and backend. The backend is written in rust mainly with the main ones being Rocket and Diesel. For now I've decided to use Blazor and C# as the frontend as I'm most familiar with them.

## Goals
The goal of this project is to make a robust and error free API that manages and extracts content from documents and can be run "headless" with or without an frontent interface like a browser.

## My reasons for creating this project
This is the first time I'm seriously making an open source project. I'm learning how exactly git works and I'm learning rust too. 

Also I've used Mayan EDMS, Paperless and Teedy which are all great managment systems, but for my own use, I wanted to integrate documents into an internall application and I found their APIs a bit lacking. I've also had problems with extracting content from documents as I think they're all forked from the same project that I have forgot the name of.

## Contributing
If you'd like, you're welcome to contribute to this project. I'd be very happy if anybody offers help! I'm still planning the project out and currently I don't have clear goals in sight, but if you have any ideas or issues feel free to open up discussions or issues!
